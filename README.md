# Najla — Deterministic Mathematical Core

> We are not building a smarter algorithm.  
> We are building a foundation that algorithms can safely stand on.

## What this is
Najla is a tiny, deterministic mathematical core for fundamental nonlinear functions
(log, log10, exp, pow), designed for systems where predictability matters more than raw intelligence.

This project is not an AI model.
It does not learn.
It does not adapt.
It does not drift.

## Core properties
- Deterministic (identical input → identical output)
- Constant-time execution
- Explicit, documented error bounds
- Bit-exact across platforms
- SHA-locked golden artifacts
- Fixed-point, hardware-friendly design

## What this demonstrates
This repository is a proof core.

It shows that:
- mathematical behavior can be frozen and verified
- learning systems do not need to sit on drifting foundations
- transparency can be engineered, not promised

## How to test (5 minutes)
Requirements:
- iverilog

Quick start:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
